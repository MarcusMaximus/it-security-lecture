# [OWASP Chapters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Chapter)

OWASP Chapters exist to raise awareness of the OWASP mission, making application security visible, at the local level.

#### [OWASP German Chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Germany)

There is one Chapter for Germany in total which is complemented by a so-called [OWASP Stammtisch](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_German_Chapter_Stammtisch_Initiative) each in several metropolitan areas such as [Hamburg](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_German_Chapter_Stammtisch_Initiative/Hamburg), Munich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart or Karlsruhe.
