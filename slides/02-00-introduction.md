# System Requirements

To perform the exercises on your private computer you need

* _either_ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (8.x, 10.x or **12.x**)
* _or_ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* _or_ [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

_:information_source: On the university computers Node.js should already be available. You can verify this by running `node -v` on the command line. It should display an 8.x (or higher) version._

_:computer: You can always fall back to your personal laptop for the exercises as it should be free from virtualization, proxying or installation hurdles!_
