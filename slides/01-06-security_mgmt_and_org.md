## Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)

> Also known as a “computer incident response team,” this group is responsible for responding to security breaches, viruses and other potentially catastrophic incidents in enterprises that face significant security risks. In addition to technical specialists capable of dealing with specific threats, it should include experts who can guide enterprise executives on appropriate communication in the wake of such incidents. The CIRT normally operates in conjunction with other enterprise groups, such as site security, public-relations and disaster recovery teams. \[[^1]\]

### [Six steps for effective Incident Response](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-incident-response)

1. <small>**Preparation**: helps organizations determine how well their CIRT will be able to respond to an incident and should involve policy, response plan/strategy, communication, documentation, determining the CIRT members, access control, tools, and training</small>
2. <small>**Identification**: process through which incidents are detected, ideally promptly to enable rapid response and therefore reduce costs and damages</small>
3. <small>**Containment**: contain the damage and prevent further damage from occurring</small>
4. <small>**Eradication**: effective incident response that entails removing the threat and restoring affected systems to their previous state</small>
5. <small>**Recovery**: testing, monitoring, and validating systems while putting them back into production in order to verify that they are not re-infected or compromised</small>

---

# 6. Lessons Learned

> Lessons learned is a critical phase of incident response because it helps to educate and improve future incident response efforts. This is the step that gives organizations the opportunity to update their incident response plans with information that may have been missed during the incident, plus complete documentation to provide information for future incidents. Lessons learned reports give a clear review of the entire incident and may be used during recap meetings, training materials for new CIRT members, or as benchmarks for comparison.

---

## Security Operations Center (SOC)

> A security operations center (SOC) is a facility that houses an information security team responsible for monitoring and analyzing an organization’s security posture on an ongoing basis. The SOC team’s goal is to detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents using a combination of technology solutions and a strong set of processes. Security operations centers are typically staffed with security analysts and engineers as well as managers who oversee security operations. SOC staff work close with [organizational incident response teams](#cyber-incident-response-team-cirt) to ensure security issues are addressed quickly upon discovery. \[[^2]\]

# Security Awareness

---

## Security Awareness

> Security awareness is a formal process for training and educating employees about IT protection. It involves:
>
> * Programs to educate employees
> * Individual responsibility for company security policies
> * Measures to audit these efforts \[[^3]\]

---

## Stages of Security Awareness

> 1. Determining the current status
> 2. Developing and crafting a security awareness program
> 3. Deploying said program to employees
> 4. Measuring the progress made by the program and revising as necessary \[[^3]\]

# Security Standards & Regulations

---

## ISO 27001

> ISO 27001 is an international standard published by the International Standardization Organization (ISO), and it describes how to manage information security in a company. The latest revision of this standard was published in 2013, and its full title is now ISO/IEC 27001:2013. The first revision of the standard was published in 2005, and it was developed based on the British standard BS 7799-2. \[[^4\]

> * A.6 **Organization of information security** – controls on how the responsibilities are assigned; also includes the controls for mobile devices and teleworking
> * A.7 **Human resources security** – controls prior to employment, during, and after the employment
> * A.8 **Asset management** – controls related to inventory of assets and acceptable use, also for information classification and media handling \[[^5]\]

---

> * A.9 **Access control** – controls for Access control policy, user access management, system and application access control, and user responsibilities
> * A.10 **Cryptography** – controls related to encryption and key management
